== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Do I need an account to use this? =

Yes, get in touch with team@soundninja.com to request a Client ID and Access Key.

= What Is Soundninja? =

Soundninja is an in-context music discovery tool; we automatically detect artist names within your web page content and give your readers an easy way to preview those artists’ songs without having to leave your page.

= Does Soundninja affect my website’s performance? =

No. Soundninja is very lightweight, the JavaScript is around 90kb in size and is super fast to download on an average connection. Our JavaScript loads asynchronously, which means it doesn’t block the other elements of your page from loading. When Soundninja has downloaded we analyse your page in the background after the content has finished loading.

= Why are some artists not automatically recognized? =

We use advanced text processing algorithms to identify artist names. The technology is still in beta and undergoing improvements, but if an artist is not automatically recognized you can utilize the Soundninja admin panel to manually add the artist.

= Which browsers does Soundninja support? =

We support all popular browsers across both desktop and mobile! :D
